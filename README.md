## Firebase + React: Chat Application
Basic chat application, letting you send and receive messages through an authorized Google login. Displaying the profilepicture of each member in the chat. 
This repo is to learn and start integrating a chat feature, tailorizing it to suit my needs both in functionality and looks for later adding it over to my [webpage][website]. 

## Test with your own Firebase collection
Steps: 
* Clone this repo & navigate to the ```src``` folder
* In the terminal, type ```touch FIREBASE_CONFIG.js``` and paste your Firebase config, end your new file with ```export default FIREBASE_CONFIG```
* ```npm i "&&" npm start" ``` and you're all set on ```localhost:3000```

**Want to try out the chat feature in production? Head over to my [website][website] and send me a message!**
